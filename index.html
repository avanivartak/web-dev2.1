            Computer coding is the use of computer programming languages to give computers and machines instructions on what actions to perform. It is the way humans communicate with machines, and it allows us to create software like programs, operating systems, and mobile apps. We can also use programming languages to create web pages and applications. Simply put, coding is used for communicating with computers. People use coding to give computers and other machines instructions on what actions to perform. Further, we use coding to program the websites, apps, and other technologies we interact with every day. Coding/programming languages are simply a set of rules defining how to write code. These rules bring machine language (those ones and zeros) closer to human language. It’s easy to think of it as a language the computer can understand. Typically, learning to code is easier with a high-level language, while low-level languages offer more freedom.We use programming languages to create software programs. A program is just a text file that serves as an instruction manual for a computer. When you launch an application, you’re telling the computer to read the text file and execute the commands therein. Since computers run on code, it’s apparent why you can find it anywhere. Computers will continue to replace outdated technology in everything from microwaves to power plants. And the presence of code in our daily lives will increase.

          <p class="text-center">
          There are dozens of coding languages. A few languages are all-purpose (or multipurpose), but most serve a specific function. Python is used for both complete software programs and websites.  JavaScript, a relatively old language, exists to make web pages more functional.C can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. There are specialized languages that are great if you need something super specific, but all you really need to get started are a few common ones.</p>
